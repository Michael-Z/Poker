The exec files are compiled from the MathLink files with the same name.
The MathLink files are essentially C code, plus some language to interface with Mathematica/CDF Player.
You must put them under in you file system under a new directory ~/MathLinkExec/ (in Unix/OSX formalism) so that the CDF knows where to get them and install them.
